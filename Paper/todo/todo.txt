Paper, TODO:

Text:
Sec 5, colour points
Sec 6, results
Sec 7, evaluation
Sec 8, future work
Sec 9, conclusion

Figures:
- Teaser
- Difference to illustrator (left: rectangular top. right: expanded with non-rectangular topology).
- Illustrator's point and click interface (one OK example, one failure case in Illustrator, plus
the pentagon example)
- "challenging shapes that require ad-hoc solutions, as shown in Fig. REF"
- Gradient mesh with holes (maybe the steps required to make it?)
- Gradient mesh with colour points.
- non-manifold mesh

Citations:
- First par: more citations (shading curve paper for example)
- sec 2: citations on 2D graphics (shading, texturing etc.)
- citation to Illustrator? (probably not, but check with gradient mesh paper)

Supplementary material
all data from user study

Video
--very-- good video demonstrating the tool. Most important because most reviewers will base their decision
on video for this type of work.
