# A Gradient Mesh Tool for Non-Rectangular Gradient Meshes

This is a research project at HiOA.
Major goals:
* Implement a basic user interface for creating and manipulating 2D gradient meshes [x]
* Implement functionality for creating gradient meshes from photographs [x]
* Multi-resolution editing capabilities [x]

## Our work has been accepted to [SIGGRAPH 2017](s2017.siggraph.org/)

- Link to additional data from User Study will come here[]()

## Implementation details
This is a C++ project using Qt 5.6 Widgets.
The project is coded with the QtCreator IDE (project file included).
The code is developed and tested with the Visual Studio 2015 compiler.

Required libraries:
* Qt 5.6
* OpenMesh 6.3 ([http://www.openmesh.org](http://www.openmesh.org/))

## Getting Started
- Clone this repo
- Modify line 9 in GradientMeshImproved.pro to point to your OpenMesh installation
- Build and run
